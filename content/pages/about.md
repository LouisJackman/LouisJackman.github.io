I'm your host, Louis Jackman. Welcome to my site.

I live in the UK and specialise in information security and software
development. I can do system administration, but that interest only goes so far
as to support other areas I'm interested in. This website's articles are mostly
around these topics, albeit with many diversions.

My CV can be found as [here](/theme/cv/louis-jackman-cv.pdf). Contact
information like my [LinkedIn profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-jackman)
can be found on the [contact page](/pages/contact.html).

Aside from my primary skills, my technological interests also include
programming language theory, concurrency and parallelism,
[langsec](http://langsec.org/), programming formalism like static typing and
proof systems, and compile-time metaprogramming. I might even have ended up a
static-typing zealot were it not for my exposure to
[Lisp](http://lisp-lang.org/) and [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/).

I'm at home in Unix-like command line environments, web browsers, and
mobile-style apps, but feel out of my element using WIMP GUIs on the desktop,
non-Unix-like operating systems, and bulky IDEs. There's nothing _wrong_ with
them, they just don't match my style of working.

I've worked with Linux, AWS, Python, Ansible, system hardening, ISMSes,
REST/HTTP, Terraform, Docker, and Java and its Spring ecosystem.  I've also
dabbled in Kubernetes, TypeScript, Selenium, WordPress, Ruby, Heroku, various
versions of Angular, React, redux, redux-observable, RxJS, and macOS. Dabbling
isn't the same as being adept, of course.

JavaScript and Rust feature heavily in my personal projects, with C and Python
also showing up from time to time. I've used Rust since 0.15, but it has
thankfully stabilised a lot since then.

My spare time is sometimes occupied with writing articles for this site and
working on projects like my programming language
[Sylan](https://sylan.technology/), but most of it is non-technological
endevours.
