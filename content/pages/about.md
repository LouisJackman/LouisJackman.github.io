I'm Louis Jackman, a security engineer in the UK specialising in information
security and software development. This website's articles are mostly around
these topics albeit with diversions.

My CV is [here](/pages/louis-jackman-cv.pdf). Additional contact information
like my [LinkedIn profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-jackman) appears
below.

I like to think that I work on an intersection between practical InfoSec and
theoretical computer science, but it's likely too little of the former and too
much of the latter in practice.

Some engineers consider themselves an "Technology Stack X Developer"; I don't.
When given the choice, I mostly stick to the trifecta of Go, TypeScript, and
Rust these days. However, technological tools come and go with the wind; there's
little point in being dogmatic about them.

My spare time is sometimes occupied with writing articles for this site and
working on projects like my programming language
[Sylan](https://github.com/LouisJackman/sylan), but most of it is
non-technological endevours.
