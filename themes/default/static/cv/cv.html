        <p>
          I'm a security engineer in London who specialises in cybersecurity and
          general software development. My experience covers appsec, infosec,
          and netsec; this includes internal pentests, appsec-focused code
          reviews, maintaining and hardening software-defined networks in the
          cloud, and helping to maintain an ISMS.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>REST Services</h3>
            <p>
              Implemented a passphrase hashing system with runtime switchable
              algorithms, constant-time operations to avoid timing-attacks, and
              a monadic validation system to tighten input data to prevent
              injections.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              I do in-house pentests and have assured clients of our company’s
              security policies and controls, our persual of ISO27001 and GDPR.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
              Container-based infrastructure atop Kubernetes,
              infrastructure-as-code with Terraform, tooling with Python 3,
              Ansible for configuration management, and maintaining a highly
              available infrastructure atop AWS with custom tooling. Enough Go
              to write small tools and understand the internals of tools like
              Kubernetes plugins.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>IoT-style Devices</h3>
            <p>
              Python 3 on Raspberry Pi utilising a serial-over-USB interface,
              abstracting byte-over-wire serial protocols into pluggable modules
              to handle different pager systems, handles program updates
              in-place, and uses AWS SQS to queue pending messages.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Internal Tooling</h3>
            <p>
              An internal service for quickly spinning up and testing
              network services, aiding the agile methodology and working with
              various branching models. Backed by Java and fronted with a
              HTML5/JavaScript frontend, and using Docker and Akka actors.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Secure Coding</h3>
            <p>
              Well versed on guidelines offered by OWASP, NIST, and CIS.
              An understanding of memory-safety, pedantically finding
              logic-holes, data-tainting, and resource exhaustion attacks
              against availability.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Pentesting</h3>
            <p>
              I keep abreast of CVEs and other general cybersecurity issues. Can
              effectively use tools like netcat, nmap, OWASP ZAP, sqlmap, msf3,
              aircrack-ng, siege, and others.
            </p>
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Agile Workflow</h3>
            <p>
              I'm used to the agile workflow of using issue ticketing systems,
              providing estimates, writing up postmortems, providing
              retrospectives, and taking ownership of code from the developer
              environment to the production server.

              C89/C99/C11 and Unix/POSIX APIs. I can do complex data-structures
              without segfaulting, and write application using lower level APIs
              like sockets without riddling code with security holes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rust, which I have used it since university back in the 0.x days.

          <li>
            <h3>The Web</h3>
            <p>
              Can do basic layouts like this page (knowing how to style both
              screen and printed PDF-style content), semantic markup with useful
              metadata, graceful degradation, and the usual build tools
              (minifiers, transpilers, and analytics).
            </p>
