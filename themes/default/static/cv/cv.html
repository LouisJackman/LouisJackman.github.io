      <section class="synopsis">
        <p>
          I specialise in information security, software development, and system
          administration. I'm currently not available for work.
        </p>
        <p>
          When composing solutions, I can implement both low-level algorithms
          and combine higher-level components together. A well-implemented
          technical solution means a lot less without good documentation and
          explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's better to deftly navigate new technologies than be known as an
          "XYZ Developer". Following that is how I obtained my current skill
          set. An understanding of CS history and fundamentals more useful
          than a penchant for chasing shiny new technologies.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>REST Web Services</h3>
            <p>
              Various Java stacks, which are detailed in the skills section.
              Implemented a passphrase hashing system with runtime switchable
              algorithms, constant-time operations to avoid timing-attacks, a
              monadic validation system, and third-party integrations.

            <h3>Security &amp; Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              I do in-house pentests. Have assured clients of our company’s
              security and privacy policies and controls, our persual of
              ISO27001 and GDPR, and compliance in different jurisdictions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Infrastructure Management</h3>
            <p>
              Using Python 3 with Ansible and boto3. I help maintain a
              self-healing and highly available cloud infrastructure atop AWS,
              with many custom utilities tying it together.
            </p>

            <h3>Code Branch Testing Tool</h3>
            <p>
              Based on Agile and GitFlow methodologies, and designed for network
              services. It allows the git branch of a network application to be
              spun up quickly and tested, is written in Java/Play Framework with
              an Angular 4 frontend, and is backed by Docker.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Pager Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Using Python 3 on Raspberry Pi, utilising a serial-over-USB
              interface via PySerial. It abstracts byte-over-wire serial
              protocols into pluggable modules to handle different pager
              systems, handles program updates in-place, and uses AWS SQS to
              queue pending messages.
